# instagram-followers

I wanted to see who doesn't follow me back.

Found the `instagrapi` library on [github](https://github.com/adw0rd/instagrapi) and gave it a go.

The libaray/api gives odd results every now and then, but sometimes it works fine which is good enough for me. It also seems to lock me out of my account and stuff when I use it too much. 

**Usage:**

1. install requirements
2. create `.env` file with your instagram username and password
3. run `python ig-followers.py`
